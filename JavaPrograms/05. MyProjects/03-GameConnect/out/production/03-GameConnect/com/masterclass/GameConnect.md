## Game Connect

Originated from a Java Programming Masterclass that got out of hand, created a fully functional game interface with TDD suite.

Created several classes and dozens of methods. Took me over a week.

I moved it to a separate project to keep developing it while continuing the course.

First step should be an API-like interface between PlayConnect and the game classes.

Drawing the board is done by PlayConnect, based on information received from the game classes.

Any console output is done by PlayConnect.

Any actions are sent to the game classes as requests, and results will be returned, including the current state of the game.

Later maybe some sort of storing the games. have a history.

Later maybe cheat and undo a move :-)
