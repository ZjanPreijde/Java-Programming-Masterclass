-Write a method called readIntegers() with a parameter called count that represents how many integers the user needs to enter.

-The method needs to read from the console until all the numbers are entered, and then return an array containing the numbers entered.

-Write a method findMin() with the array as a parameter. The method needs to return the minimum value in the array.

-In the main() method read the count from the console and call the method readIntegers() with the count parameter. 

-Then call the findMin() method passing the array returned from the call to the readIntegers() method.

-Finally, print the minimum element in the array.

Tips: 
	-Assume that the user will only enter numbers, never letters
	-For simplicity, create a Scanner as a static field to help with data input
	-Create a new console project with the name MinElementChallenge
