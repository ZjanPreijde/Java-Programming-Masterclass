        // Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport.
        // The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store
        // a list of teams that belong to the league.
        //
        // Your class should have a method to print out the teams in order,
        // with the team at the top of the league printed first.
        //
        // Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular
        // instance of the league class - the program should fail to compile
        // if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
